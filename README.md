# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

### Rubric Points

Video of the car moving along the track for more than 4.3 miles without any incident can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/cG-B7MmEtaw)

#### Valid Trajectories

Car was able to drive at more than 4.32 miles without any incident . The statistics can be seen in below image

#### Model Description

All code realted to model is in main.cpp . Working of the model can be broken into below parts

##### Prediction
We are using data from sensor fusion which is returned by simulator to predict other vechile positon. we have used this data to predict future position of car in all lanes so that it can be used to behaviour planning to take appropriate action.
`Prediction Code at lines 168 - 211`

##### Collision Avoidance / Behaviour Planning

Based on the prediction returned from prediction code we decide the behaviour of the car. Below behaviour were taken care off in the code.
1. If car in front and safe distance is less than 30 m , slow the speed to avoid collision.
2. Move left if left lane is free and it's not the left most lane.
3. Move right if right lane is free and it's not the right most lane.
4. Keep Lane if left or right lane are not safe for lane change .

`Collision/Behaviour Code at lines 338 - 380`

##### Limiting jerk while accelerating/decelerating
To limit the jerk while accelerating/decelerating have added code to reduce the speed at 5 miles/hr if another car is near to our car or increase at 5 miles/hr if no car in front of us and we are below speed limit. 

##### Trajectory Generation
For trajectory generation have used 5 waypoints in xy coordinates to fit the spline curves. Out of the 5 way points first 2 way points are previous points returned from the simulator and left 3 way points are generated by keeping a gap of 30 between each `(code at 423-425)` 
Once all the 5 way points are calculated , these points are then transformed from global system to car's local coordinates keeping car at 0,0  and yaw at 0 degree. After that these points are passed to spline function for caluculating points.
Previous points returned from the simulator are loaded into `next_x_vals` and `next_y_vals` first and then the remaining points from 50 are inserted to next_x_vals and next_y_vals using spline function. But we do convert back to global coordinate system before adding them to next_x_vals and next_y_vals vectors.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.
